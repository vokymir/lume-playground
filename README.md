# Lume playground => RR website
I created this project to try out (Deno's)[https://deno.com/] static web generator (lume)[https://lume.land/].
In the process it became clear to me that it's an awesome tool I want to build at least one website with. 
Therefore it is no more a playground, more like repo for our Royal Rangers community. I hope to achieve nice looking, easy-to-manage website.

# I am using
- Deno
- Lume
